Composition with effect objects even in the single-item wands instead of hardcoding the effects. Will easily allow transposing wands to wand foci.
(Actually, can't even do that since items don't have entities attached... unless we inject a field into ItemStack but like that's dumb)

# Mechanics
- Chunk Vis and Flux
  - The more aura nodes in a chunk, the faster vis regenerates in the chunk
- Aura Nodes
  - Generate throughout the world
  - Are generated with COMPOUND ASPECTS of a certain strength
    - If not widened with a Node Stabilizer, will only provide primal aspects. Think of it as expanding a pinprick of a black hole: instead of mulching everything that goes through into energy, now it can let atoms (compound aspects) through.
  - If flux gets too high in the chunk and surpasses an aura node's strength, it consumes all flux and turns into a tiny flux rift
    - Pried-open nodes have a 0.25 modifier applied to their strength.
